Recruiting talent via the PyBites Platform
==========================================

Starting with why
-----------------

To learn about the ideology about this technology / tier, read our article: `Why whiteboard interviews suck and what weâ€™re doing about it <https://pybit.es/whiteboard-interviews.html>`_.

Pre-requisite
-------------
You have to be signed up to our platform with a username/email, or using Github login: `<http://codechalleng.es/signup>`_. Make sure you confirm your email which is required to register a license key.

In this helper doc we have 3 users: Tim is a recruiter and Sara and Ramit are interviewees. We will show you how to set up an interview Bite as the recruiter and send out private interview links (tokens) to the interviewees and watch their submissions.

Register your license key
-------------------------

After buying a license key from our `Enterprise pricing page <https://codechalleng.es/bites/pricing/enterprise>`_ register it under Settings or with the direct purchase link provided in the purchase email (e.g. `<https://codechalleng.es/purchase/access_code/PB-U8N435EH-PG65PW87-IXPWQG5T-898XSZI4>`_).

You get a confirmation/welcome message:

Click the settings link in the message, you are presented with the following screen showing your license keys and amount of interview tokens purchased:

Your own space on PyBites
-------------------------

At this point you need to set a *company slug* for your Interview Bites, see it as your private corner in the PyBites universe. As we're movie fans let's have our slug called *nolan*:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58949996-06c21800-878e-11e9-9818-6d5edead7b39.png
   :width: 600

At this point you see your private *Interview Bites* in the sidebar. Click on it or on the *Manage your interview bites* button while still in settings:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950152-5bfe2980-878e-11e9-8036-7b9338617fdf.png

You see the amount of Interview Bites you have available on your account (currently 1 for each 50 purchased tokens).

Add Interview Bites
-------------------

You can add a new Interview Bite by clicking the *Add new Bite* button:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950208-80f29c80-878e-11e9-9d3b-46b58345e042.png

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950222-89e36e00-878e-11e9-86bc-e85cc1a9416d.png

As you see we support quite some external libraries you can use. You can also hide the tests to potentially make it more difficult, and (exciting!) you can set a deadline in minutes to make it even more tough!

Copy our Bites
--------------

But maybe you don't want to write your own exercises, we can affirm it's pretty hard and time consuming. So why not re-use on or our Bites, we have almost 200 of them at the time of this writing. After the previous setup you should see a *copy this bite* button on our Bites (except the Intro Bites) which we demo next:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950357-e2b30680-878e-11e9-81a1-01f73e5bf810.png

Here we navigated to Bite 2 which has some kick-ass regex problems for the candidate to solve. Notice the "Copy this Bite" button, and click it:

The Bite is now copied to your private Interview Bites!

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950417-070ee300-878f-11e9-929d-77514c73f530.png

Click on "Edit / Publish" to make any changes. Here I update the title and toggled "Published" on:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950485-332a6400-878f-11e9-8db0-9bc34f4ee0de.png

2 new links appeared: *Submissions* and *Manage interview tokens*:

Interviewee links
-----------------

Click on *Manage interview tokens* to generate private interviewee links (tokens):

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950642-8e5c5680-878f-11e9-8b4d-eebbc1c7acce.png

Let's generate 20 interview links for this one:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950657-961bfb00-878f-11e9-9dac-14c9acce4cbc.png

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58951306-11ca7780-8791-11e9-8c16-fe1f27575e9d.png

Your balance went down with 20 but you can still recover those token spots by deleting them. The real token balance credit happens when interviewers start to redeem the links.

For example here I deleted 3 tokens, recovering some of my balance:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58951340-260e7480-8791-11e9-91a7-047462aecf9d.png

Interviewing people
-------------------

Let's send Ramit and Sara an interview link, just click the copy button on the first two token rows.

Sara entered the interview token in her browser and gets presented with our typical Bite interface: 

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58951377-40485280-8791-11e9-9090-0bc265024b8d.png

To show you that each token is unique to an interviewee here is what happens when Ramit redeems the same link:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58951555-b51b8c80-8791-11e9-96cd-ea4850cf1864.png

Let's compare this with the timer view. Tim now set 60 minutes on the Bite, let's get Ramit to open the Bite now:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58951697-14799c80-8792-11e9-8037-e31e436a0f7e.png

He gets a timer now!

As Tim, the Recruiter, refresh the page. You can now see the tokens being redeemed:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58951762-3c690000-8792-11e9-9587-e5f917c7be4a.png

Interview submissions
---------------------

Fast forward a bit, having Sara and Ramit submit some code, when you go back to the submissions page this is how it would look:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58952334-afbf4180-8793-11e9-9705-da9f71e3598e.png

You see their final codes and last submits. Interview Bites are not scored at this point but you see some emojis if a timer was set and the deadline was hit or missed.

Download interview data
-----------------------

We added a download feature to not lose any data upon deleting Interview Bites to free up Bite slots on your license (currently you get 1 for each 50 purchased interview tokens).

To download a zip file with all the interviewee's submissions just click the button on the Bite:

Feedback
--------

We hope this new way of interviewing (pre-screening) makes the hiring process more agile and will save you a lot of time. As always we're very open to your feedback to make the platform better, just ping us `on the platform <https://codechalleng.es/inbox/new>`_.
