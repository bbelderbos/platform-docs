## Recruit talent via PyBites Platform

In this helper doc we have 3 users: Tim is a recruiter and Sara and Ramit are interviewees. We will show you how to set up an interview Bite as the recruiter and send out private interview links (tokens) to the interviewees and watch their submissions.

After buying a license key from our [Enterprise pricing page](https://codechalleng.es/bites/pricing/enterprise) register it under Settings or with the direct purchase link provided in the purchase email (e.g. [https://codechalleng.es/purchase/access_code/PB-U8N435EH-PG65PW87-IXPWQG5T-898XSZI4](https://codechalleng.es/purchase/access_code/PB-U8N435EH-PG65PW87-IXPWQG5T-898XSZI4))
