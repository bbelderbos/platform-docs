## Recruit talent via PyBites Platform


Pre-requisite: sign up to our platform with a username/email, or using Github login: [http://codechalleng.es/signup](http://codechalleng.es/signup). Make sure you confirm your email.

In this helper doc we have 3 users: Tim is a recruiter and Sara and Ramit are interviewees. We will show you how to set up an interview Bite as the recruiter and send out private interview links (tokens) to the interviewees and watch their submissions.

After buying a license key from our [Enterprise pricing page](https://codechalleng.es/bites/pricing/enterprise) register it under Settings or with the direct purchase link provided in the purchase email (e.g. [https://codechalleng.es/purchase/access_code/PB-U8N435EH-PG65PW87-IXPWQG5T-898XSZI4](https://codechalleng.es/purchase/access_code/PB-U8N435EH-PG65PW87-IXPWQG5T-898XSZI4))

You get a confirmation/welcome message:

Click the settings link in the message, you are presented with the following screen showing your license keys and amount of interview tokens purchased:

At this point you need to set a _company slug_ for your Interview Bites, see it as your private corner in the PyBites universe. As we're movie fans let's have our slug called _nolan_:

<img width="1313" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58949996-06c21800-878e-11e9-9818-6d5edead7b39.png">

At this point you see your private _Interview Bites_ in the sidebar. Click on it or on the _Manage your interview bites_ button while still in settings:

<img width="1312" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950152-5bfe2980-878e-11e9-8036-7b9338617fdf.png">

You see the amount of Interview Bites you have available on your account (currently 1 for each 50 purchased tokens). You can add a new Interview Bite by clicking the _Add new Bite_ button:

<img width="1297" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950222-89e36e00-878e-11e9-86bc-e85cc1a9416d.png">

As you see we support quite some external libraries you can use. You can also hide the tests to potentially make it more difficult, and (exciting!) you can set a deadline in minutes to make it even more tough!

But maybe you don't want to write your own exercises, we can affirm it's pretty hard and time consuming. So why not re-use on or our Bites, we have almost 200 of them at the time of this writing. After the previous setup you should see a _copy this bite_ button on our Bites (except the Intro Bites) which we demo next:

<img width="1297" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950357-e2b30680-878e-11e9-81a1-01f73e5bf810.png">

Here we navigated to Bite 2 which has some kick-ass regex problems for the candidate to solve. Notice the "Copy this Bite" button, and click it:

The Bite is now copied to your private Interview Bites!

Click on "Edit / Publish" to make any changes. Here I update the title and toggled "Published" on:

<img width="1297" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58950485-332a6400-878f-11e9-8db0-9bc34f4ee0de.png">

2 new links appeared: _Submissions_ and _Manage interview tokens_:

Click the latter:

Let's generate 20 interview links for this one:

Your balance went down with 20 but you can still recover those token spots by deleting them. The real token balance credit happens when interviewers start to redeem the links.

For example here I deleted 3 tokens, recovering some of my balance:

Let's send Ramit and Sara an interview link, just click the copy button on the first two token rows.

Sara entered the interview token in her browser and gets presented with our typical Bite interface:

To show you that each token is unique to an interviewee here is what happens when Ramit redeems the same link:

Let's compare this with the timer view. Tim now set 60 minutes on the Bite, let's get Ramit to open the Bite now:

He gets a timer now!

As Tim, the Recruiter, refresh the page. You can now see the tokens being redeemed:

Fast forward a bit, having Sara and Ramit submit some code, when you go back to the submissions page this is how it would look:

<img width="1442" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/387927/58952399-e39a6700-8793-11e9-92fc-73e80b79ed86.png">

You see their final codes and last submits. Interview Bites are not scored at this point but you see some emojis if a timer was set and the deadline was hit or missed. You can also download a zip file with all the interviewee's submission:
