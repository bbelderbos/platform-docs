Welcome to PyBites Platform
===========================

Our goal with our coding platform is to get your coding. A lot!

We have grown to a vibrant community of Pythonistas eager to learn every nook and cranny of the Python language and ecosystem.

However in order to learn just reading a book, or watching a video is not gonna cut it, you need real world, hands-on practice.

Enter PyBites. We have almost 200 exercises you can code in the comfort of your browser, all with automated tests to verify your code.

You can share your code on the forums, learning from other developers, earning Ninja belts and certificates along the way.
